# challenge-01

## Description
To complete this project successfully, I had to semantically organize code, consolidate redundant css stylings, and provide detailed comments among other tasks, in order to properly format the code of the given website without altering any part of it. The most challenging part of this project was learning and getting used to using git commands and getting through many error messages. I was able to learn how to properly interact with my repo through repetition and use shortcuts for my code as well.
